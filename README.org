* R7RS compliance test

This tool measures the R7RS compliance levels of multiple Scheme
implementations, and formats the output onto a web page.

It also runs the Larceny benchmarks, and ranks implementations based on
performance.

** Requirements

1. Install the Scheme implementations under test, and make sure they are on
   =$PATH=.
2. Edit =implementations.sld= in =compliance= with additional information
   about the implementations under test, if necessary.
3. Run =gosh main.scm=.
